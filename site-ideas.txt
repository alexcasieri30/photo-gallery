ideas for photo gallery site

title bar top of page in center
    - home, about, gallery, contact, tech (page describing how the site was built)



need title page
    - background photo? 
    - carousel with rotating photos


i like the idea of different random widgets all over the home page 

for example:
- a widget that appears to be at a random location on the page
- each widget has its own theme

    - carousel with rotating 10 photos with a certain theme
    - one image fades into the next 
    - grid of small blocks, where when you hover over one the image blows up and comes to life
    - file cabinet type design, where there is a strip of only the tops of photos
      and as you hover on each one, it expands down into a full photo
        - ex: https://brand.base.org/


Colorful scrollbar on the side like this:
    - https://www.risingtemps.com/

Some kind of effect that follows your mouse around the page

infinite scroll loop? 


plus icon in the top right corner that you can click on that adds an image to the gallery
- superuser only

Theme idea:
- stuff that appears or fades in or slides in from the sides as you scroll down 


small 'grid' that looks like this:

Organizing photos:

sections of each photo:

- trip/country
- main-object
- number/id?

example:
- hawaii-monkeypodtree-1
- hawaii-hike-1
- japan-temple-1
- chicago-sunset-1
- chicago-sunset-2


Photo displays:
Idea - 
    4 rows of photos, each row is slowly rotating in opposite directions
